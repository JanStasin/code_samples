# Definitions:

X_train: Provided Dataset with product descriptions for Training
Y_train: Provided Dataset with product categories for Training
X_test: Provided Dataset with product descriptions for Testing
Y_test: Dataset (not provided) to be generated using the Models with product categories, based on learnings from X_train & Y_train datasets, with an additional column "prdtypename"

# Todo next (03.07.2025)

1. Run Models on X_Test
2. Based on #1 generate a Y_test with columns:
    prdtypecode, prdtypename

    prdtypecode will be generated by the models, based on learnings on the Training X_train & Y_train datasets

    prdtypename will be mapped based on the Category names that we found in the Manual Research phase, so that we can randomly give a manual check the accuracy of our models on the X_test dataset
